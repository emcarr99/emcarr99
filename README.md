### âœ¨Hi! I find coding to be a natural fit for me because it speaks to how I process information. It's like solving a puzzle, and I love the feeling of accomplishment that comes with finding a solution to a problem. In addition to my analytical side, I'm also a creative person who loves to express myself through various mediums.âœ¨ 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a song sorter application that will allow you to input any artist and get a spreadsheet with your ranked songs from that artist.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python & C#
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lorenagracex@gmail.com 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know every word to every Taylor Swift song but I also love going to all sorts of concerts! Some of my favorites have been death metal shows, such as Horrendous.
